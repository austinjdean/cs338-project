Austin Dean - CS 338 - Project Part 5 Readme file

The "IcoMoon-Free-master" directory contains the icons I used in designing this web interface.

The principal web page in this project is p5.html. All other pages in the project can be reached from there, and navigation behaves much like a typical website.

This demo concentrates on look and feel mostly, and since my topic is a largely informational (rather than functional) site, I dedicated the extra time to perfecting the CSS and layout.

Features that work:
- The homepage in p5.html
- Viewing the artist page for Fleet Foxes (denoted by the filled-in star on the homepage)
- Sign out
- Navigation between pages
